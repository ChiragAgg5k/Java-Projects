# Java Projects

This is a collection of projects I have worked on in Java. It contains very basic programs I made while learning about the language as well some more complex projects. But they are all entirely made in Java.

## Projects

### - Calculator

made using Java Swing library. It is a basic calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations.

### - Snake Game

also made using Java Swing library. But is a lot more complex that the one above. It is a snake game that can be played by the user. The snake can be controlled using the arrow keys. The snake can eat food and grow in size. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself.
